# Day 7 Task: Understanding package manager and systemctl

### What is a package manager in Linux?
 
 In simpler words, a package manager is a tool that allows users to install, remove, upgrade, configure and manage software packages on an operating system. The package manager can be a graphical application like a software center or a command line tool like apt-get or pacman.

 You’ll often find me using the term ‘package’ in tutorials and articles, To understand package manager, you must understand what a package is.

### What is a package?
 
 A package is usually referred to an application but it could be a GUI application, command line tool or a software library (required by other software programs). A package is essentially an archive file containing the binary executable, configuration file and sometimes information about the dependencies.

### Different kinds of package managers
 Package Managers differ based on packaging system but same packaging system may have more than one package manager.

 For example, RPM has Yum and DNF package managers. For DEB, you have apt-get, aptitude command line based package managers.


## Tasks

 1) You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers
    
    --- steps to install the jenkins in the ubuntu
         sudo apt update--update the system package repository by running.
         sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y--install the java11-version.
         curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null---
         ## Start by importing the GPG key. The GPG key verifies package integrity but there is no output. Run.
         echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
         ---## Add the Jenkins software repository to the source list and provide the authentication key
         Installation of the Jenkins
         --sudo apt update --update the system package repository by running.
         --sudo apt install jenkins -y -- installation of the jenkins
         --sudo systemctl status jenkins -- To check if Jenkins is installed and running, run the following command

    --- steps to install the Docker in the ubuntu
        sudo apt install docker.io
        --sudo systemctl status docker 
        --sudo systemctl enable docker
        --sudo systemctl start docker
        --sudo systemctl status docker ---- To check if docker is installed and running, run the following command

 2) Write a small blog or article to install these tools using package managers on Ubuntu and CentOS


### systemctl and systemd

 systemctl is used to examine and control the state of “systemd” system and service manager. systemd is system and service manager for Unix like operating systems(most of the distributions, not all).


## Tasks

 1) check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed)
    --sudo systemctl enable docker
    --sudo systemctl start docker
    --sudo systemctl status docker ---- To check if docker is installed and running, run the following command

 2) stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots
    -- sudo systemctl stop docker
    -- sudo systemctl stop jenkins
    

 3) read about the commands systemctl vs service

 eg. `systemctl status docker` vs `service docker status`
