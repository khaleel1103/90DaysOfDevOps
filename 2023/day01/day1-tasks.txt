--What is DevOps
--DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
--What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure
--Automation: DevOps automation is the addition of technology that performs tasks with reduced human assistance to  processes that facilitate feedback loops between operations and development teams so that iterative updates can be deployed faster to applications in production.
--Scaling : Scaling in DevOps is characterized as an automation-driven environment where developers or enterprises can adopt DevOps culture and choose the right technologies to scale their business growth.
--Infrastructure : Infrastructure as code (IaC) uses DevOps methodology and versioning with a descriptive model to define and deploy infrastructure, such as networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topologies.
--Why DevOps is Important, etc?
--DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployment.
